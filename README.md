This project informs the user of the importance of mental health. The app first takes in the user input of any common emotion that they are feeling, which is then linked to a spotify playlist that can help alleviate the emotion that the user is undergoing. Our application also includes information tid-bits of the emotion that they choose. Some of the emotions that we included are happy, sad, anxious, unmotivated, lethargic, hype, excited, hopeful, optimistic, tearful, heartbroken, moody, angry, nervous, and confused. This app is targeted to accompany the user throughout the day, allowing them to ultimately be in tune with their emotional state.
